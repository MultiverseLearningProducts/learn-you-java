    <h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>There are a few software projects that you could now try.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fizz Buzz</li>
<li>Rock paper scissors</li>
<li>Fruit machine</li>
<li>Connect 4</li>
<li>Battleships</li>
<li>21 Card game</li>
<li>Score a tennis match</li>
<li>Score 10 pin bowling</li>
</ul>
<h2>Fizz Buzz</h2>
<p>loop through numbers one to 100 in a full loop.<br>
Then if a number is divisible by three you should replace the number with the word FIZZ. If a number is divisible by five you should replace the number with the word BUZZ. If a number is divisible by three and five you should replace that number with the word FIZZBUZZ.</p>
<h2>Rock Paper Scissors</h2>
<p>You choose one of the following [Rock, Paper, Scissors]. Then your Java program also chooses. Then match your choices together.</p>
<p>Rock beats Scissors<br>
Paper beats Rock<br>
Scissors beat Paper</p>
<p>Rock lose against Paper<br>
Paper lose against Scissors<br>
Scissors lose against Rock</p>
<p>Print out a winning statement, can you keep track of your score against the Java runtime?</p>

The goal of the Connect Four game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one’s own discs.</td><td style="text-align:left"><figure><img src="https://images.nexusapp.co/assets/2f/7d/3b/313877873.jpg" alt="connect 4 game"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></td></tr>

The object is to make the sum of your card values as close to 21, without going over. If we make 21 exactly, we have blackjack, which can't be beat. If we go over 21, we 'bust' and we lose the round. The player is allowed to stop hitting at any point.</li><li>Once our hand is finished, the dealer tries to do the same. The dealer must keep hitting until they get to 17.

<h2>Tennis</h2>
<h3>How does tennis scoring work?</h3>
<p>Tennis matches work in three phases: A game, a set and a match.</p>
<p>A game is played until a player scores four points, of which a player can earn in a number of different ways (more on that below).</p>
<p>A set is collection of games, played until a player wins six games (or more).</p>
<p>A match is played to a best-of-three or five sets. Usually, championship matches are played to five sets. We can play for 3 sets.</p>

<p>Kournikova wins the match because she won 2 of 3 sets. Bouchard won only set 2, she beat Kournikova by 2 games.</p>
<p>You'd want to think about writing a program to help keep track of the scores.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java"><span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Match(Player player1, Player player2);

<p>Then some kind of input from the terminal?</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">Set 1, Game 1 who is the winner?
<span class="hljs-variable">$player2</span>

<p>And you could display the score board in the terminal.</p>

<tr><td style="text-align:left">A game consists of ten frames, which start with a full rack of ten pins. In each frame, you have two deliveries of your ball, in which to knock down as many of the ten pins as you can.<br/><br/>If you knock down all the pins on your first ball, it is called a strike. The score doesn't get added on straight away because for a strike, you get the values of your next two balls as a bonus. For example, if you score a strike in the first frame, then an 7 and 1 in the second frame, you would score 18 (10+7+1) for the first frame, and 8 for the second frame, making a total of 26 after two frames.<br/><br/>If you knock down some of the pins on the first ball, and knocked down the remainder of the pins in the second ball, it is known as a spare. Again, the score doesn't get added on straight away because for a spare, you get the values of your next ball as a bonus. For example, you if score a spare in the first frame, say an 6 and a 4, then got an 8 and a 1 in the second frame, you would score 18 (6+4+8) for the first frame, and 9 for the second frame, making a total of 27 after two frames.<br/><br/>When it comes to the final frame, it is slightly different. In the final frame, you get bonus balls if you strike or spare, to a maximum of three deliveries. If you strike in the first delivery you have the opportunity to strike in the remaining two and have three deliveries in total. If you scored strikes in each of your final three deliveries, the score for the final frame would be 30 (10+10+10). If you spare the final frame, you get the third delivery as a bonus. So, a spare, 9 and 1, followed by a strike would equal 20 (9+1+10).</td><td style="text-align:left"><figure><img src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3ba42df7f6abfee37ffc96b5566a0490396f8c201ded3626fd2e71cc3cde6d3e/687474703a2f2f7777772e6a756c69656e736c6976652e636f6d2f696d616765732f6c6f742f363238342f36323834315f302e6a7067" alt="Jesus"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></td></tr>
