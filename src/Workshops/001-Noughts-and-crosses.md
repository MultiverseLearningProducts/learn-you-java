# Noughts and Crosses

In this workshop, you are going to use all the things you have learned about Java code to write a computer program! Our program is going to accept input from the user, store and update the state, it will print out the state so the user can see it, and finally conclude with a win, lose or draw result. What you have studied so far are the primitives of Java, branching logic, and Arrays. These are like the words and phrases of a spoken language. When we write a computer program we combine all these building blocks and compose a story.
