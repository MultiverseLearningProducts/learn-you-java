# Hotels

Object orientated programming (OOP) is a style of programming. The Java language has been created to capture and express this style of programming. We need to learn about OOP in order to read and write Java code. There are a set of core concepts and values that you need to know about to start writing Java code like a pro. The main idea behind OOP is that our computer program should model how things are and how things relate to each other in the real world. For example today we are going to build a hotel. Our hotel will have rooms and guests and a location, just like hotels do in the real world.
